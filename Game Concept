Game concept: Side scrolling 2d platformer, but when you are on the ground and not moving time is stopped. It will be a bullet hell kind of like the mario maker levels which have a million projectiles but the difference is that you have as much time as you need to plan out your next jump. It's a singular very long level with no checkpoints, but when you die you know how to jump to get back to the place you died at (the level isn't random and doesn't change). Bonus feature: after you reach the end it replays all the jumps in real time without the pauses in between. It would look like the jumps you spent minutes planning were thought of in a split second.
